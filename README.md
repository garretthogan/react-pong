## How to Play

- **Goal:** Get the ball past the AI’s paddle. First to 11 points wins.
- **Your paddle** is at the bottom (green by default). Keep the ball in play and try to make the AI miss.
- **Ball speed** increases a bit with each hit, so rallies get faster. The ball also bounces off the side walls.

## Controls

| Input | Action |
|-------|--------|
| **Mouse** | Move left/right to move your paddle *(enable “Enable Mouse Control” in the left panel first)* |
| **Arrow keys** | ← → to move your paddle |
| **A / D** | Same as arrow keys |

Click **START GAME** to begin. Use the left panel to turn on mouse control and change colors if you like.

## What You Can Adjust

- **Right panel – Theme music:** Volume slider and mute for the background music.
- **Right panel – AI difficulty:** Slider from 0 (easy) to 1 (hard). Higher = faster, more accurate AI.
- **Right panel – Base ball speed:** How fast the ball starts (1–50). Your choice is saved for next time.
- **Left panel – Color theme:** Change paddle, ball, and court colors.
- **Left panel – Enable Mouse Control:** Turn on mouse movement for the paddle.

Scores and your settings (ball speed, difficulty, volume, mute, colors) are saved in your browser so they’re there next time you play.
